# Creating a Beautiful ASP.NET Core application

This project contains an example of ASP.NET Core application using the MVC template. 
This app is an example of the article I produced for the Telerik Blog (telerik.com/blogs).

Technologies used in this project:

- .NET 7
- ASP.NET Core
- JSON file as database

To run this project locally you need to have the .NET 7 SDK installed.
